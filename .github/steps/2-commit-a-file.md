## Step 2: Commit a file

_You created a branch! :tada:_

Creating a branch allows you to edit your project without changing the `main` branch. Now that you have a branch, itâ€™s time to create a file and make your first commit!

**What is a commit?**: A _[commit](https://docs.github.com/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/about-commits)_ is a set of changes to the files and folders in your project. A commit exists in a branch. For more information, see "[About commits](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/about-commits)".

### :keyboard: Activity: Your first commit

The following steps will guide you through the process of committing a change on GitHub. A commit records changes to the project such as adding/removing/renaming files and modifying file content. For this exercise, committing a change will be adding a new file to your new branch.

> [!NOTE]
> `.md` is a file extension that creates a Markdown file. You can learn more about Markdown by visiting "[Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)" in our docs or by taking the "[Communicating using Markdown](https://github.com/skills/communicate-using-markdown)" Skills Exercise.

1. On the **< > Code** tab in the header menu of your repository, make sure you're on your new branch `my-first-branch`.

2. Select the **Add file** drop-down and click **Create new file**.

3. In the **Name your file...** field, enter `PROFILE.md`.

4. In the **Enter file contents here** area, copy the following content to your file:

   ```
   Welcome to my GitHub profile!
   ```

5. Click **Commit changes...** in the upper right corner above the contents box. A dialog will appear.

6. GitHub offers a simple default message, but let's change it slightly for practice. Enter `Add PROFILE.md` in the **Commit message** field.
   
   - A **commit message** and optional **extended description** help provide clarity for your changes. This is particularly useful when your commit involves several files.

6. In this lesson, we'll ignore the other fields for now and click **Commit changes**.

7. Now that you've changed a file, Mona should already be busy checking your work. Give her a moment and keep watch in the comments. You will see her respond with progress info and the next lesson.

If you don't get feedback, here are some things to check:
- Make sure you are on the `my-first-branch` branch.
- Ensure the `PROFILE.md` file is created and in the root folder.
